Introductions to build and deploy agtv:

Windows with MINGW (has to be in the PATH):
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [-DQT_ROOT_PATH=PATH_TO_QT] [-DVLC_QT_PATH=PATH_TO_VLC_QT]
        mingw32-make

    (with, e.g., QT_ROOT_PATH=E:\Qt\5.5\mingw492_32 and VLC_QT_PATH=E:\Qt\VLC-Qt_1.0.0_win32_mingw)

    Specifying VLC_QT_PATH lets cmake look for the VLC-Qt package (https://vlc-qt.tano.si/) and if found
    activates the internal VLC player.

    To make a package:
        mingw32-make package
    
Windows with Visual Studio 2013 and nmake:
    First start by opening the 'VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt' to be sure that the correct
    enviroment variables are set. After that the build process can be started by
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [-DQT_ROOT_PATH=PATH_TO_QT] [-DVLC_QT_PATH=PATH_TO_VLC_QT]
        nmake

    (with, e.g., QT_ROOT_PATH=E:\Qt\5.5\msvc2013_64 and VLC_QT_PATH=E:\Qt\VLC-Qt_1.0.0_win64_msvc2013)

    Specifying VLC_QT_PATH lets cmake look for the VLC-Qt package (https://vlc-qt.tano.si/) and if found
    activates the internal VLC player.

    To make a package:
        mingw32-make package

    Note: An msbuild.exe build does not work, yet.
