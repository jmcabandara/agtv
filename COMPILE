Introductions to build and deploy agtv:

Windows with MINGW (has to be in the PATH):
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [-DQT_ROOT_PATH=PATH_TO_QT] [-DVLC_QT_PATH=PATH_TO_VLC_QT]
        mingw32-make

    (with, e.g., QT_ROOT_PATH=E:\Qt\5.5\mingw492_32 and VLC_QT_PATH=E:\Qt\VLC-Qt_1.0.0_win32_mingw)

    Specifying VLC_QT_PATH lets cmake look for the VLC-Qt package (https://vlc-qt.tano.si/) and if found
    activates the internal VLC player.

    To make a package:
        mingw32-make package
    
Windows with Visual Studio 2013 and nmake:
    First start by opening the 'VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt' to be sure that the correct
    enviroment variables are set. After that the build process can be started by
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [-DQT_ROOT_PATH=PATH_TO_QT] [-DVLC_QT_PATH=PATH_TO_VLC_QT] [-SSL_DIR=PATH_TO_OPENSSL]
        nmake

    (with, e.g., QT_ROOT_PATH=E:\Qt\5.5\msvc2013_64, VLC_QT_PATH=E:\Qt\VLC-Qt_1.0.0_win64_msvc2013 and -SSL_DIR=E:\openssl-1.0.2e-x64_86-win64)

    Specifying VLC_QT_PATH lets cmake look for the VLC-Qt package (https://vlc-qt.tano.si/) and if found
    activates the internal VLC player.

    For Windows it may be necessary to specify the SSL_DIR and supply a openssl build to get a working deployable package.

    To make a package:
        nmake package

    Note: An msbuild.exe build does not work, yet.

Debian:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCPACK_GENERATOR="DEB" [-DQT_ROOT_PATH=PATH_TO_QT] [-DVLC_QT_PATH=PATH_TO_VLC_QT]
        make

    (with, e.g., QT_ROOT_PATH=/home/user/Qt/5.5/gcc and VLC_QT_PATH=/usr)

    Specifying VLC_QT_PATH lets cmake look for the VLC-Qt package (https://vlc-qt.tano.si/) and if found
    activates the internal VLC player.

    This has been tested using the Ubuntu packages provided from https://vlc-qt.tano.si/.

    To make a package (as we specified DEB as generator, we get a debian package):
        make package
